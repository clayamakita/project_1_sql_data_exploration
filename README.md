# Portfolio Project 1 - SQL Data Exploration

This project was inspired by a [video from Alex the Analyst] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM).

Its goal is to showcase how to perform data exploration using SQL on a database with COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccination worlwide and by country. The dataset was downloaded from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) on August 16, 2021 and contains data until August 15, 2021. The notebook with the analysis and thought process are on a file called Portfolio Project 1 - SQL Data Exploration.ipynb.

The skills used in this project include: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, and Creating Views.

In addition, in order to import the dataset into a SQL Server, we had to perform a series of extra queries, not mentioned in the video, because we could only use a .csv file. The queries are in the file data_preparation.sql.
